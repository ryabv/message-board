## How to run

Run command `npm start` in project folder, it will automatically start backend and frontend.

If you have some troubles with starting backend, you should use node with version from `.nvmrc`.
1. If you don't have `nvm` run `npm i nvm -g`;
2. Run from `backend` folder `nvm use`;
3. Return to project folder and try `npm start` again.
